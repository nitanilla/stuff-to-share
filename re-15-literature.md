FACTS: The student customer must separate their role as customer, educator, and (fellow) studen, faculty without requirements engineering experience often make better customers. We have noted that experienced practitioners tend to impose their perspectives on the process. Industrial partners can be very effective simulated cus-tomers, Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find a partner that can make a time commitment to a classroom schedule.  There are significant pedagogical risks associated with using real customers â€“ they are relatively uncontrollable and their needs may not match the learning objectives. The emo-tional maturity in our student population may not have been high enough for this pedagogical approach |
